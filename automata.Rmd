In general, after randomly or deterministically initialising a grid of cells, a cellular automaton determines the state of a new cell via **(a)** a defined rule, and **(b)** the state of a specific set of cells.

\vspace{10pt}

In the case of elementary cellular automata.  The initial grid is a row vector, and each cell has only two possible states: 0 or 1.  The initial row vector can be a randomly or deterministically created grid of zeros \& ones.  Thereafter, the state of each next generation cell, i.e., each cell of the next row down, depends on a defined elementary cellular automaton rule & specific cells in the current/active row.  This project creates functions for exploring elementary cellular automata, including

* Elementary cellular automata rules functions.
* A generic cell updating function that updates cells according to a provided rule.
* A generic row updating function that creates a next generation row w.r.t **(a)** a current/active row, and **(b)** a provided rule.
* A generic automata matrix function that creates elementary cellular automata matrices.

The exploration of elementary cellular automata is via **(a)** Wolfram's Rule 30, and **(b)** newly created custom rules.^[Rule 30 is decscribed in [Statistical mechanics of cellular automata](https://doi.org/10.1103/RevModPhys.55.601)]

# A Reference Frame

In this document, each outlined elementary cellular automaton rule determines the state of a next generation cell via the same set of active/current row vector cells.  In brief, each new generation cell depends on the state of three cells of the preceding generation, as illustrated in *Fig. 1*.

\vspace{10pt}

```{r cells, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '65%', echo=FALSE, fig.cap = 'The cells that determine the state of a next generation cell'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = './images/cell.png', auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

\vspace{10pt}

Bearing *Fig. 1* in mind, and noting that an elementary automaton cell only has 2 possible states: 0 or 1.  Then there are $2^{3}$ possible combinations of zeros & ones w.r.t. 3 contiguous cells.  These $2^{3}$ state combinations form the reference frame of each elementary cellular automaton rule in this document.  *Table 1* outlines the combination; not that $i$, $j$, and $k$ denote

* i: the state of the first of three contiguous cells of a row vector.
* j: the state of the second of three contiguous cells of a row vector.
* k: the state of the third of three contiguous cells of a row vector.

Contiguity w.r.t. edge cells is as illustrated in *Fig. 1*.

\vspace{10pt}

```{r}
reference <- data.frame(i = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1),
                        j = c(0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1),
                        k = c(0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1))
knitr::kable(reference, caption = 'The eight possible state combinations of 3 contiguous cells.  Each cell has 2 possible states: 0 or 1.')
```

The document's examples illustrate that the rules can be differentiated in terms of the set of states they create in relation to the reference frame.

# Automata Matrix Fundamentals

This section describes a set of functions that are used to create the matrix of an elementary cellular automaton.

\vspace{20pt}

## Automaton Rule 30 Function

We need a rule to determine the state of a next generation cell, based on the cells of the active/current row, as illustrated in *Fig. 1*.  Wolfram's Rule 30 is one of a number of elementary automaton rules for determining the state of a next generation cell.  Herein, Rule 30 is encoded in the function *AutomataRule( )*.  The state of a new generation cell due to Rule 30, and the reference frame, is

\vspace{10pt}

\small

```{r echo = TRUE}
  # Applying Rule 30 to the states outlined in the reference
  # frame; Rule 30 is encoded in the AutomataRule( ) function.
  states <- reference %>%
          mutate(state = mapply(FUN = AutomataRule, i = i, j = j, k = k))

```

\normalsize

\vspace{10pt}

```{r}
knitr::kable(states, caption = "The state of a new cell w.r.t. Wolfram's Rule 30")
```


Now, we have a rule for a cell updating function.

\vspace{20pt}

## Update Cell Function

The cell update function *UpdateCell( )* uses an elementary cellular automaton rule function to assign a state to a new generation cell.  In this example, a starting row of length $11$ is created, and the *UpdateCell( )* function sets the state of each next generation cell via the Rule 30 function, i.e., via the *AutomataRule( )* function.

\vspace{10pt}

\small

```{r comment = '         ', echo = TRUE}
  # A starting row of an elementary cellular automaton
  N <- 11
  element <- floor(median(c(1, N)))
  tensor <- numeric(length = N)
  tensor[element] <- 1

  # Then, the state of the cells of the next generation, i.e., row 2, w.r.t.
  # starting row 'tensor' and rule function 'AutomataRule( )'
  latest <- mapply(UpdateCell,
         index = seq(from = 1, to = N),
         MoreArgs = list('tensor' = tensor, 'FUN' = AutomataRule))

```

\normalsize

\vspace{10pt}

The starting row:
```{r comment = '         '}
tensor
```

The next generation
```{r comment = '         '}
latest
```

\vspace{20pt}

## Row Updating Functions

A row updating function sets the state of an entire new generation row.  There are 2 row updating functions available

* *UpdateRowIndependent( )*: This function does not depend on the external *UpdateCell( )* function.
* *UpdateRowDependent( )*: This function depends on the *UpdateCell( )* function.

Regardless, their results are the same.  Both are tested here via *UpdateTensor( )*, which is used to create a three-row automaton matrix as instructed in the project brief.  In-line with the project brief, the starting row of the three-row matrix is the same as the previously created starting row vector, i.e., it is

```{r comment = '         '}
tensor
```

<!--- the iterations variable --->
```{r}
iterations <- 3
```

Setting variable *iterations = 3*, the three-row automaton matrix

\small
```{r comment = '         ', echo = TRUE}
  #  w.r.t. *UpdateRowIndependent( )*
  UpdateTensor(iterations = iterations,
               tensor = tensor,
               FUN = UpdateRowIndependent,
               rule = AutomataRule)
```

\vspace{10pt}


```{r comment = '         ', echo = TRUE}
  # w.r.t. *UpdateRowDependent( )*
  UpdateTensor(iterations = iterations,
               tensor = tensor,
               FUN = UpdateRowDependent,
               rule = AutomataRule)
```

\normalsize

\vspace{20pt}

## The Matrix Function

The function *AutomataMatrix( )* creates elementary automata matrices, and it builds on the preceding functions.  In brief

* One of its parameters is an automaton rule function parameter.
* It implicitly uses a row updating function to build a matrix.

Additionally, it requires a starting row vector, and it needs to know the number of matrix rows required.  The code below tests the *AutomataMatrix( )*.  Thus far in this document only one rule function has been created $\rightarrow$ *AutomataRule( )*, hence it is used for the test.

\vspace{10pt}

\small

```{r echo = TRUE}
  # Starting row length > N
  N <- 21

  # Starting row vector > tensor
  tensor <- numeric(length = N)
  element <- median(c(1, N))
  tensor[element] <- 1

  # Testing AutomataMatrix: iterations is the number of matrix rows
  pattern <- AutomataMatrix(iterations = 10, tensor = tensor, FUN = AutomataRule)
```

\normalsize

\vspace{10pt}

The resulting numeric pattern, stored in variable *pattern*, is

\small
<!--- the numeric pattern --->
```{r comment = '                  ', echo = TRUE}
# Previewing the automaton matrix
prmatrix(pattern, rowlab = rep('', nrow(pattern)), collab = rep('', ncol(pattern)))
```
\normalsize

\vspace{35pt}

# The Image Of a Matrix

It is easier to observe the pattern of an elementary cellular automaton matrix via an image of the matrix. The image of the preceding automaton matrix is

<!--- the image of the pattern --->
```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 6, fig.align = 'center', out.extra = 'angle=-90'}
image(pattern, col = c('white', 'black'), axes = FALSE)
```

\vspace{20pt}

## Random Start

Herein, an exploration of cellular automata due to starting row vectors of randomly placed zeros & ones.  The probability of a zero or one is 0.5 each.  The code below illustrates the creation of automaton matrices due to such starting row vectors; the starting row vector length is $50$, and the number of automaton matrix rows is $25$.

```{r echo = TRUE}
# Creating cellular automata matrices based on starting row vectors with
# randomly placed zeros & ones.  Matrices are created via the
# AutomataMatrix( ) function, and using the AutomataRule( ) function.

# The length of the starting row vector > N
N <- 50

# The starting row vector of randomly placed zeros & ones > tensor
tensor <- sample(x = 0:1, size = N, replace = TRUE, prob = c('0' = 0.5, '1' = 0.5))

# An automaton matrix named 'randomstart'; 'iterations' is the number of automaton matrix rows.
randomstart <- AutomataMatrix(iterations = 25, tensor = tensor, FUN = AutomataRule)
```

The resulting image is

```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 6, fig.align = 'center', out.extra = 'angle=-90'}
image(randomstart, col = c('white', 'black'), axes = FALSE)
```

\vspace{35pt}

# A New Rule

Alternatives, an alternative, to the Rule 30 function *AutomataRule( )*.  Readers have access to three of the tried rules via the functions

* *AutomataStateRule( )*
* *AutomataRandomRule( )*
* *AutomataModuloRule( )*

which are listed within the *functions* directory. However, the focus herein is *AutomataStateRule( )*.

\vspace{20pt}

## The Automata State Rule

The *AutomataStateRule( )* is based on the sum of the 0/1 states of the three cells that dictate the state of a new cell.  It is

$$sum(i, j, k) %% 2$$

Hence,

```{r}
states <- reference %>%
        mutate(state = mapply(FUN = AutomataStateRule, i = i, j = j, k = k))
knitr::kable(states, caption = 'The state of a new cell w.r.t. Automata State Rule')
```

\vspace{20pt}

## Exploring the Automata State Rule

In addition to a rule, the pattern of an automata matrix, and the richness or peculiarity of the pattern, also depends on the starting row's

* pattern, or otherwise, of zeros & ones
* length

Noting that the extent to which a pattern/anything can be discerned depends on the number of automata matrix rows, i.e., the number of iterations.  Hence, herein a rule's automata matrix/image depends on, and is created w.r.t

* Starting row length
* The distribution of zeros & ones in the starting row ... example -> c('0' = 0.95, '1' = 0.05)
* The number of automata matrix rows, including the starting row
* An automata rule

The *AutomataExperiment( )* function encodes this set-up. Now, an Automata State Rule image example:


```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 6, fig.align = 'center', out.extra = 'angle=-90'}
AutomataExperiment(N = 49, prob = c('0' = 0.95, '1' = 0.05), iterations = 25, FUN = AutomataStateRule)
```
